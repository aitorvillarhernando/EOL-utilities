# EOL Utilities - Chrome extension.

## Features
* **Posts counter** for the threads on the forum "elotrolado.net".
* **Ad-blocker**. It removes the ads after the page load, so you're not going to see the ads but your browser is going to load them.
* **Improved UI/UX**. This option adds some styles to the website. These are minor changes. This option is on a beta phase so if you experiment some issues using it, please contact me.

### Posts counter
Allows you to:
* Choose the URL of the thread to loop (the current thread URL is autofilled in the URL field).
* Set the start page for the counting process (included a button to automatically choose between the first page, the current page and the last page).
* Optionally, the user can add a users list to filter the users inside there (no case-sensitive but need to respect the spaces).
* A sort selector for the results.

### Ad-blocker
Simply removes the ads from the website **after** loading them. This avoids you to see them, but they print anyway.

### Improved UI/UX
This adds:
* Minors improvements on the general interface, such as turns the links color to orange or add some transitions on some hover animations.
* It moves the "Preview", "Save draft" and "Send" buttons to the bottom of the page when editing or creating a post.

## Available languages
The currently available languages are: **Spanish**, **Catalan** and **English**
